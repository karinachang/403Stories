Amidst the chaos of life, he found solace in a sea of goldfish crackers.

His solace was shortlived and he was once again in the chaos when he reached the bottom of the bag.

That was his last bag of goldfish. His last source of peace.

He wept. 

The bed beckoned him to rest his weary head.

He dreamt.

The goldfish did a sweet kickflip in his dream.

He woke.

The cries of joy rang from his bed room for everyone to hear.

He wept.
