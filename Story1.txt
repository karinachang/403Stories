He drank to remember the pain and wrote to forget her name.
Another sip.
Smoke from the lips.
Waking up smelling wood shavings from the boards on the floor.
Reminded of the moments they shared together.
After crumpling another failed attempt, he downed his bottle and snuffed his cigar.
He knew no matter how many time he tried, nothing would get her name out of his mind.
