He bet it all on a horse named 'Last Chance'.

The man walked into the races, wallet full of the cash his friend gave him to pay back The Boss. He knew he shouldn't have gambled all of his money away, but the thought of getting rich from just a minute of adrenaline was too tempting. On his way to The Boss, he heard a group of men talking about a racehorse guaranteed to win. (to be continued...)

He thought he was invisible, silent, hidden. The men knew he was there. They saw. They knew. They planned.
The men murmured rumors of a rigged horse, knowing the intruder would place his bets. 
They needed the intruder to stay indebited to the boss. For the boss was in love.
